# Catch Phrase

This is a simple Catch Phrase game written for Android. Many of the words in it were taken from http://www.wordfrequency.info/.

Your goal is to get your team to guess the word you see before time runs out so you can pass it to the next team. Whoever has the phone when time runs out, the other team gets a point (they can also get an extra point if they can steal the word).
